# HackUPC23

Inspiration
We have been inspired by HP, thanks to the challenge they proposed during the HackUPC event presentation.

What it does
Our proyect generates 13 images for each of the 100 objects of the dataset given. Moreover, taht images are shown in a web page.

How we built it
We carried out an analysis of the HP system, preprocessed the provided dataset, and constructed a model that predicts the stock of a product in a specific week.

Challenges we ran into
Understanding the HP system, knowing how to relate the company's idiosyncrasy with the dataset, cleaning the dataset, and building the model for inference are crucial steps in this process.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having understood the functioning of the system that HP possesses, being able to propose a solution to a real problem, and achieving good results supported by metrics are key aspects of the project.

What we learned
Fighting against real-life problems and being able to navigate the field of data science for the first time.

What's next for HP Supply Chain Optimization
Developing the study of new data preprocessing techniques and conducting in-depth research on different models is a commendable endeavor.
